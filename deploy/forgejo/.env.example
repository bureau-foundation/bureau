# Bureau Forgejo Configuration
#
# Copy this file to .env and adjust values for your deployment.
# All settings have sensible defaults for single-machine local use.
#
# Domain, URL, and other Forgejo settings live in app.ini (copy from
# app.ini.example). This file controls Docker Compose port mapping
# and container user identity only.

# Host-side ports. Change these if 3000 or 2222 conflict with other
# services on the host.
BUREAU_FORGEJO_HTTP_PORT=3000
BUREAU_FORGEJO_SSH_PORT=2222

# UID/GID for file ownership inside the container. Must match the owner
# of the forgejo-data volume on the host. Defaults to 1000 (typical
# first user on Linux).
# BUREAU_FORGEJO_UID=1000
# BUREAU_FORGEJO_GID=1000
