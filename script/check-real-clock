# Reject direct time package calls in test files. Tests must use lib/clock
# (FakeClock for deterministic time, Real for documented exceptions).
#
# Banned calls: time.Now, time.Sleep, time.After, time.NewTimer,
# time.NewTicker, time.AfterFunc, time.Since, time.Until.
#
# These create wall-clock dependencies that cause flaky tests, slow CI, and
# nondeterministic behavior. The fake clock at lib/clock provides
# deterministic replacements for all of them.
#
# Bureau is event-driven (Matrix /sync). Tests — including integration
# tests — should be event-driven too. Polling loops and sleep-based waits
# are never the right answer.
#
# Exemptions:
#   - lib/clock/ itself (implements the clock abstraction)
#   - Lines with //nolint:realclock (for timeout safety valves and kernel
#     I/O deadlines where wall time is genuinely required)
#
# Only checks lines ADDED in the staged diff, so existing violations do not
# block commits. New violations must either use the fake clock or justify
# the real clock with //nolint:realclock.
