# Manual pre-commit hook entry point. Delegates to lefthook which reads
# lefthook.yml for the actual hook configuration.
#
# Lefthook installs its own .git/hooks/pre-commit during nix develop
# (via shellHook). This script exists for running hooks manually
# outside of a git commit (e.g., script/pre-commit to validate before
# pushing).
